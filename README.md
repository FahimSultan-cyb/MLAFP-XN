## 🧠 Abstract

Infectious fungi have become an increasing global concern. Antifungal peptides (AFPs) offer a promising, selective, and low-toxicity mechanism for eliminating fungal pathogens. To support effective drug development, precise identification of therapeutic AFPs is essential.

This work proposes **MLAFP-XN**, a deep learning-based strategy for classifying active antifungal peptides from sequence data. It leverages eight advanced feature extraction techniques and applies **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)** for selecting the top 500 features. After evaluating 24 machine learning classifiers, we selected the four most effective models based on rigorous performance benchmarks. Notably, the MLAFP-XN framework achieved up to **99.48% accuracy** on independent test sets. We also developed an interactive web server to support community access and utilized **SHAP** for interpreting feature importance in a biologically meaningful way.
